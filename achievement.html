<br> <b>"Achievement is the act of achieving or performing and obtaining by exertion ,successful performance and it is something which an individual has succeeded in it especially after a lot of effort.</br>
<br> My achievement started in my university days which was really a great testimony for me. My first year in the university, I met a lot of people who are of good behavior while some are of bad behavior,</br>
<br> some friend s influence me to join their bad gang of which I said no to them. I was very happy with my 100 level result then cause I impress my parent and getting to my second semester, my parent bought</br> 
<br> a lot of things for me to be a serious student and not to play too much with my studies and I should be very prayerful. I followed my parent advice and everything is going on smoothly.</br>
<br> My achievement started or occur when I was in secondary school,</br> 
<br> During my 200l I met some new friends of which we read and do things together not until they started behaving somehow of which we are no more serious but with the help of my parent advice and prayer</br>
<br> everything went well Alhamdulillah.</br>
